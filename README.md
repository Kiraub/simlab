# SimLab simplified branch

## Binaries and class diagram

Binaries can be found under `bin/win/`.
A class diagram with an excerpt of the used classes can be found under `docs/`

## About the engine

Made using the Godot Engine and written entirely in GDScript.

To open it inside your local Godot installation simply clone the repo and add the directory `simlab/` to your project list.

Note that the used version of Godot was 3.1.2 at first and later switched to 3.2.

## About the program

This program contains an abstract simulation of a restaurant with waiters, customers, tables and entrances/ exits which are grouped together as portals.
It features a GUI to contain a single simulation view, with a set of buttons for controlling it.
The simulation exposes configurable objects to the GUI which the user can open and configure freely.

## Background

This project was made during my traineeship for a school related task.

It was my first time using the Godot Engine and programming in GDScript.

Therefore a lot of the code is organically grown and it developed as i got more familiar with the engine and its features, conveniences and not so convenient bits.
