# SimLab

## About the engine

Made using the Godot Engine and written entirely in GDScript.

To open it inside your local Godot installation simply clone the repo and add the directory /simlab to your project list.

Note that the used version of Godot was 3.1.2 at first and later switched to 3.2.

## About the program

This program contains an abstract simulation of a restaurant with waiters, customers, tables and entrancess/ exits which are grouped together as portals.
It features a GUI to contain multiple simulation views, each with their own set of buttons for controlling it.
The simulations expose configurable objects to the GUI which the user can open and configure freely.

## Background

This project was made during my traineeship for a school related task.

It was my first time using the Godot Engine and programming in GDScript.

Therefore a lot of the code is organically grown and it developed as i got more familiar with the engine and its features, conveniences and not so convenient bits.
